# Netatmo_Vector_Security
Vector displays a series of still images from a Netatmo Presence security camera.

This script requires netatmo-api-python by philippelt,
https://github.com/philippelt/netatmo-api-python

...and a Netatmo Presence camera.

To make the script run automatically when motion is detected I use Apple iOS Home app which has automation features that run a script when motion is deteced.
You may be able to use the linked Netatmo API above to do the detection locally, please fork my script if you do!
